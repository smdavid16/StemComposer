#  StemComposer

**Deconstruct to Recompose.**

**StemComposer** is a powerful, Python-based audio processing tool designed to separate any mixed audio track into its individual, high-fidelity stems. Whether you need isolated vocals for a remix, a clean drum break for sampling, or instrumental tracks for practice, StemComposer seamlessly extracts them.

By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, StemComposer takes a single audio file (like an MP3 or WAV) and splits it into isolated tracks:
-  **Vocals**
-  **Drums**
-  **Bass**
-  **Other Instruments** (Piano, Synth, Guitar, etc.)
